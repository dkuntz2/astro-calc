    <h1>Astro Photography Calculators</h1>

    <p>
      This calculator can help you determine a proper shutter speed for capturing photos of the night sky, provided an ISO speed and lens <em>f</em>-stop.
    </p>

    <form id="calculator">
      <div class="set">
        <label for="iso">ISO Speed</label>
        <input type="number" id="iso" name="iso" min="1" value="800" />
      </div>

      <div class="set">
        <label for="fstop"><em>f</em>-stop</label>
        <input type="number" step="any", min="0.001" id="fstop" name="fstop" value="1.8" />
      </div>

      <div class="set">
        <label for="relev">Adjust</label>
        <input type="number" step="any" id="relev" name="relev", value="0" />

    <h2>Raw Shutter Speed: <span id="shutter"></span></h2>

    <h3>Dealing With Film</h3>
    <p>
      When shooting long exposures with film, you need to deal with reciprocity failure (the relationship between shutter speed and exposure breaking down).
      Thankfully, Ilford publishes what those values are for their black and white films, which means we can calculate the correct shutter speed.
    </p>

    <h4>Shutter Speed for FP4: <span id="fp4shutter"></span></h4>
    <h4>Shutter Speed for HP5: <span id="hp5shutter"></span></h4>

    <p><small>
      As a general note, film loves getting light, so overexposing is generally not an issue.
      As such, you probably can't go wrong with just leaving the shutter open forever.
      <small>(okay, forever is probably too long)</small>
    </small></p>

    <p><small>
      <strong>This is <em>not</em> true for digital sensors.</strong>
      If you overexpose by too much on a digital camera you will lose all detail in the affected areas.
    </small></p>

    <h3>Technical Notes</h3>

    <p>
      This calculator assumes you're working with an EV of -10.
      -10 was selected because it's a good working value for capturing the galactic center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The equations used for determine shutter speeds are based on those in the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value">Exposure Value</a> entry.
    </p>

    <h4>Determining the relative EV based on ISO speed:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      EV<sub>relative</sub> = EV<sub>base</sub> + log<sub>2</sub>(ISO/100)
    </blockquote>
    Which ultimately translates to
    <blockquote>
      EV = -10 + log<sub>2</sub>(ISO/100)
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Determining the shutter speed for a given EV and <em>f</em>-stop:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        EV = log<sub>2</sub>(<em>f</em><sup>2</sup> / S)
      </blockquote>
      Which is reduced to
      <blockquote>
        S = <em>f</em><sup>2</sup> / 2<sup>EV</sup>
      </blockquote>
